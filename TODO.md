# TODO

Populate with decent test data.
Improve types - have one type for API response (matches schema) and one for the data stored as a result of this (e.g. Image).
Consistency - choose "root" or "app" and use everywhere?
Split sagas down by state slice, maybe even more to "store" folder.
Improve service - add params consistently.
Clear error when navigating away from upload page
Add eslint
Update page title in index.html
Sort out dependencies/dev dependencies.
Write README
Delete TODO
Put demo on Netlify

## Improvements

Tests (unit and integration).
Further break down components, make them more reusable.
Improve certain types, e.g. yields.
Tokens for colours, spacing, etc, rather than hard-coded values.
Would've done more granular commits.
